<summary><h2>A Little Background on Henrique</h2></summary>
<br>
Everyone has experienced those "what if" moments: what if I tried something different? What if I'm letting opportunities slip by? What if I succeed?

That's how I got into web development. After 4 frustrating attempts, I decided to give it a 5th try. And it worked! I've always enjoyed helping others with computers in all of the 3 jobs I've had in my life, and everyone always said the same thing: "Oh, you look like someone who loves PCs! Why don't you go into IT?"

I thought, you know what? You guys are right - I really do love 'em! While still working in my earlier area of expertise, I chose now to dedicate myself to what I've always loved to do the most: playing with browsers! I spend every spare moment of my day reading about code or writing code.

I just want to know as much as possible about how to tweak things. My joy with the web is precisely that. It's not about money or fame; I just really want to create things. With finesse! 👌🏻

If you come across anything in my projects and want to make a PR to show me how it can be improved, feel free! Comment whatever you like.
